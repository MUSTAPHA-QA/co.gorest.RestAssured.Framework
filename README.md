# # REST Assured API Testing Framework for gorest.co API BY MUSTAPHA-QA

**## About the Project**

**### Overview**

- This project presents a comprehensive REST API testing framework designed to automate API testing of gorest.co API, ensuring its quality and reliability. It focuses on testing the CRUD operations on the gorest.co API.

**### Features**

- List of the key features:
  - Test cases covering GET, POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP requests: the  framework covers all essential HTTP methods for interacting with the API endpoints.
  - Data generation using POJOs and Faker library: for the creation of realistic test data, enhancing the robustness and validity of the tests.
  - Extent report and logging: for comprehensive test results and to provide detailed and organized test results for easy monitoring and analysis of test outcomes, aiding in     debugging and identifying potential issues.

**### Technologies Used**

- List the technologies employed:
  - IDE: Eclipse
  - Coding language: Java
  - Test automation framework: TestNG
  - API testing library: REST Assured
  - Build and project management tool: Maven

**## Framework Structure**

- The framework's structure is organized into four packages:

  - ```
    api.endpoints
    ```

    - Routes class which encapsulates URLs.
    - Endpoints classe for CRUD operations.

  - ```
    api.payload
    ```

    - Houses POJO classe representing model data used for testing.

  - ```
    api.test
    ```

    - Contains test classes with actual test methods executing HTTP requests.
    - Employs setup method to generate test data using POJOs and Faker.

  - ```
    api.utilities
    ```

    - Contains the ExtentReportManager class for report generation.

**## Setup and Usage**

- Add necessary dependencies according to the pom.xml file.

**## Project Structure**

To ensure a clear and organized project structure, we've adopted the following conventions:

- Source code:
  - All project packages are located within the `src/test/java`folder, as this is the standard directory for test code in Maven projects.
- External resources:
  - The `src/test/resources` folder serves as a repository for external files essential for testing, including:
    - Schema files for JSON schema validation
    - Configuration files like `log4j2.xml`for logging

**## Results Achieved** 

- Comprehensive validation of API responses:
  - **Successful status code verification:** All response status codes matched expectations based on the Swagger document, ensuring successful HTTP requests.
  - **Accurate response body:** Response body data consistently aligned with the API's Swagger document, verifying data integrity.
  - **Header validation:** Selected response headers were verified for correctness.
- Robust error handling:
  - **Meaningful error messages and status codes:** The API returns informative error messages and appropriate status codes in various error scenarios, aiding in troubleshooting and debugging.
- JSON schema validation:
  - **Schema compliance verified:** JSON schemas were successfully validated for different HTTP requests, ensuring adherence to data structure and format requirements.

### Challenges
- **Managing Generated User IDs:** Storing the dynamically generated user ID during POST requests and retrieving it for subsequent API operations was challenging, especially when ensuring data consistency and test independence and to resolve this issue we've used the ITestContext interface from TestNG which provides a mechanism for communication and data sharing between test methods within test classes.
